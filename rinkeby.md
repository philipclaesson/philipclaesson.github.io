## What is it?
Programming Without Borders Rinkeby aims at teaching programming to kids in Rinkeby, Stockholm. Our goal is to awake the kids' interest in technology (as well as education) and showing them a possible career within tech!

The workshops was started as a collaboration between **Engineers Without Borders KTH, Yennenga Progress and Red Cross Sp√•nga**. While I am no longer active, I am happy to see that the workshops are still running and growing.

The weekly workshops was visited by 10-20 kids and 5-10 volunteers from unis and employers in Stockholm, such as **KTH, Google, Tesla, Mathworks**. The workshops also received support from from **King, Google and Mathworks**.
